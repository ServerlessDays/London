      <h1>Danilo Poccia</h1>
      <p>Danilo works with startups and companies of any size to support their innovation. In his role as Technical Evangelist at Amazon Web Services, he leverages his experience to help people bringing their ideas to life, focusing on event-driven programming and serverless architectures, and on the technical and business impact of machine learning and edge computing.</p>
      <h2>Talk: Evolutionary Serverless Architectures with Safe Deployments</h2>
      <p>The term "architecture" applied to software can bring the idea of static, difficult to change, solutions. Unfortunately, that is often the result of a software implementation.<br/><br/>    An evolutionary architecture designs for incremental change in an architecture as a first principle, looking at software development over time as an optimization task, using a "fitness function" to estimate the efficiency of a software release.<br/><br/>    In this session, weâ€™ll show how to automate a CI/CD pipeline to compute a fitness function during deployment, using a pre-traffic hook Lambda function dynamically analyzing the configuration of the resources implemented via AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) templates.</p>
