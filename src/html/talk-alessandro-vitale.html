      <h2>Talk: Lessons from the trenches: building an enterprise Artificial Intelligence chatbot platform on serverless</h2>
      <p>This session will showcase how Conversate built the new version of our enterprise Artificial Intelligence chatbot platform using serverless. The platform has Enterprise features such as multiple deployment environments (development, staging, production) and developers can deploy code together with Machine Learning models. We leveraged serverless (AWS lambda) to build a PaaS to guarantee security, separation, ease of deployment and integrity of what is deployed in a transparent way to the developer. In the talk, we will go through the project of designing and building the platform, explaining why we choose serverless, what we found being pros & cons for this unique use case and future directions.</p>
