      <h2>Workshop: Debugging on the shifting sands of serverless</h2>
      <p>Serverless infrastructures are created anew for every event and as a result, workflows vary a bit each time they run. This variability limits the value of staging and pre-production testing, while insufficient observability makes production debugging no less challenging â€” and perhaps more so.<br/><br/>    With no stable infrastructure on which to install agents or daemons, the usual ways to collect, batch and publish data in the background are simply not available. More importantly, data can only be collected during a function invocation. As a result, instead of monitoring toward a known good state, serverless favors event-level observability tools that enable observers to peek into systems at critical junctures.<br/><br/>    This workshop will include a live demo of Rookout production debugging platform, and free trial accounts for all participants.<br/><br/>    In this workshop you will learn to debug LIVE serverless functions, use non-breaking breakpoints to instrument your code on the fly, connect your functions to aggregation solutions (such as ELK)  on demand, and debug complex architectures (e.g. serverless with microservices).</p>
