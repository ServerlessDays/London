      <h2>Talk: Serverless Analytics on AWS (for absolute beginners)</h2>
      <p>Need a quick and simple mechanism to collect, analyse and visualise data from your serverless apps, without running servers of course? In this case study, we’ll explore one example of application simplification and cost optimisation by removing Elasticsearch and Kibana from an application architecture, replacing them with a scalable serverless alternative, reducing running costs for the app by more than 90% in the process. Based on AWS services, this talk will feature AWS Lambda, Kinesis, Glue, Athena & QuickSight.</p>
