      <h2>Talk: Serverless Authentication with JWT</h2>
      <p>Authentication is one of the big parts of every application. Security is always something that is changing and evolving. In this talk, I will cover what JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are and why using JWTs in your applications when it comes to security is awesome<br/><br/>    Setting up an authentication layer is, without doubt, one of the most challenging yet necessary tasks within any web application. Not only does the application in question always needs to ensure the most basic functionality is set up by default (such as login, logout, reset password), but additionally, itâ€™s required to develop all the libraries to handle the validation of the credentials, the connections to the database responsible for the user data, session management, and general security. In this talk, we will look at how we can use JSON Web Tokens to add both Authentication and Authorization to our functions. With Auth0 authentication, which is an online web service that handles authentication protocols like OAuth2, LDAP, and OpenID Connect to allow clients to create authenticated services without the need to build the entire infrastructure. This way, an application can retrieve user-related data and showcase protected information to only logged in users.</p>
