      <h2>Talk: CosmosDB – database for Serverless era</h2>
      <p>We are now getting into the serverless era. Many already known development patterns and solutions are not valid anymore. We need to solve issues in a bit different way. New challenges are waiting for us.<br/><br/>    One of such challenges is data storing. The classic approach is not good enough. We expect to be able to have a solution in which we will have instant access to all data, schema-less date structure, scalable throughput and global replication.<br/><br/>    CosmosDB fulfils all of those requirements. During this workshop, you will learn using CosmosDb in your serverless solutions.</p>
