      <p>Mattias has been working professionally as a developer for almost 20 years. His interest in coding started already in the 80s with the Commodore 128 and the true passion came with the Amiga. Today he's a partner and senior architect at WCOM, a Microsoft partner located in Gothenburg, Sweden. He’s also a Microsoft Azure MVP and a member of the OzCode Magician community. Outside work he is a father of two, husband of one and contributes actively to the .NET open source community.

      <h2>Talk: From napkin to service in minutes – with serverless on Azure</h2>
      <p>Today cloud services have in an unprecedented way - made technology available and affordable, enabling rapidly getting that minimal viable product out the door; even if you’re on a tight schedule and/or budget. In this talk it will explain how he in minutes went from an idea to a published service, without breaking the bank. And at the same time being focused on the “business problem”, all achieved by using services like Twitter, IFTTT, GitHub, OneDrive and Buffer; technologies like Azure Functions, Azure Storage Queues and Notepad. This won’t be a textbook example - but it’ll be a good show case on what can be done ;)</p>
