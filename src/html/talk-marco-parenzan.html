      <h2>Talk: Build a serverless, distributed Pong game with Azure</h2>
      <p>When you want to build a game for fun and profit, you don't like thinking about infrastructure, but focus on business and pay only few, better if you are a startup. But when you build a distributed game, you need state, and state is costly. So having new cloud technologies moving towards serverless, seems we are reaching our goals.<br/><br/>    In this live demo, we'll build a distributed pong game, allowing playing over Internet thanks to some Azure PaaS and Serverless services like Service Fabric Mesh, Functions, Event Grid, Azure SignalR, Azure Storage, and having some fun with them.</p>
