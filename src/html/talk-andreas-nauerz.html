      <h2>Talk: From single functions to entirely serverless applications: Orchestrating serverless solutions using Composer</h2>
      <p>Building scalable serverless architectures requires more stateless functions and cloud services. How do you coordinate and manage application state using stateless functions, independent cloud services, external APIs? Whilst also maximising code reuse, enabling modular development and creating resilient architectures. New programming platforms need new programming paradigms...<br/><br/>    In this talk, we'll look at the issues and challenges of building scalable architectures and look at new approaches to "composing" serverless applications using new open-source tools.<br/><br/>    This talk will introduce a new open-source serverless tool, Composer, developed by IBM Research that aims to resolve some of issues developer face in the serverless community. It will identify common architectures that struggle with using serverless platforms and think about how to re-implement them with these new approaches.</p>
