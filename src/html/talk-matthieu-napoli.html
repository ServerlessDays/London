      <h2>Talk: Deploying serverless PHP applications</h2>
      <p>Serverless and its "functions as a service" is becoming a more and more widespread solution for running web applications. And while PHP powers 80% of the web, using it on FaaS providers is not a piece of cake. Let's bridge that gap and discover why PHP is perfect for serverless applications. Through the Bref project we will explore how to easily deploy Symfony, Laravel and other PHP applications as lambdas, and what it means regarding performances and costs.</p>
