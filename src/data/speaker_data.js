Can we adapt and modify existing practices to expose the inherent chaos in our serverless applications? What are the limitations and new challenges that we need to consider?\n\rJoin us in this talk as Yan Cui shares his thought experiments, and actual experiments, in his pursuit to understand how we can apply the principles of chaos to a serverless architecture.

Some of the steps become a lot more difficult in Serverless environments.\n\r The need for observability is still one of the most important things if you are running in production. Hence, you need proper logging, distributed tracing, monitoring, and alerting. Also, security is still a top concern while new challenges like cold start adding extra complexity to Serverless environments."
