    abstract: `Since AWS launched Lambda in 2014, the term ‚Äúserverless‚Äù has been used (and misused) to describe compute models, technologies, architectural patterns, operational constructs, and even rebranded cgi-bins. The term is now used so broadly that it‚Äôs turning into a buzzword with no discernible meaning.

    In this talk, we‚Äôll cut through all the marketing hype, and discuss why the underlying concept of ‚Äúserverless‚Äù, and the superpowers that come with it, are much more important than the name itself. We‚Äôll cover:
    - A brief history of development and how/why we got to serverless
    - Why serverless requires developers to think differently about how applications are built
    - Serverless use cases that add real business value
    - Problems with serverless and what the industry needs to do better

But how do functions and fully-managed services interact? Via events! Events are important for serverless. Event-driven architectures help you to adopt some of the best practices for distributed systems without even realizing it. Let‚Äôs see what events and event-driven programming can bring to the table, what we can learn to build better and easier to manage serverless applications.`,
